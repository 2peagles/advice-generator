### What I learned

There is mutiple ways of writing code and for using this api I could have done useReducer or axios but I decided to keep it simple and use state/ effect on this one. The css is clean but idk if anyone has suggestion I would love to hear it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
span:nth-child(3)::after{
  content:url('/images/pattern-divider-desktop.svg')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
